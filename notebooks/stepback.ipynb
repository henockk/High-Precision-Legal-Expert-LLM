The Advisor is required to provide an invoice to the Company for the services rendered, and the Fees are payable within ten days from the beginning of the following month against a duly issued tax invoice. The Billable Hour is defined as the net time devoted to the provisioning of the Services, excluding meals, travels, or any other overhead time borne by the Advisor.\\n\\n2. Workspace Expense: In addition to the hourly fees, the Company shall pay the Advisor USD 100 per month to finance a workspace, provided that the Advisor actually hires a professional workspace. This Workspace Expense is also payable within ten days from the beginning of the following month against a duly issued tax invoice.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the Advisor will not be entitled to any additional fees or expense reimbursement unless expressly provided for in the Agreement. Additionally, the Advisor is responsible for any income taxes or other assessments imposed by governmental authorities on the compensation received under the Agreement.'"
